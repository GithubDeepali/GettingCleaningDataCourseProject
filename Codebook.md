This document provides th defination of columns used in the run.analysis.R provided in the repository


The below describes the columns of the tidy dataset obtained after following step 1 to step 5 in the readme file and how the tidy dataset.csv contains:


1.The first variable  "Subject"  denotes the subject number that performed an activity. In total there are 30 subjects.

2.The second variable  "Activity"  denotes the activity performed by the subject. There are six activites, listed here:

•WALKING
•WALKING_UPSTAIRS
•WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
•SITTING
•STANDING
•LAYING

3. A total of 79 features were selected from the original data: only the estimated mean and standard deviations, using a  grepl  on  "mean|std" . These features form the 79 other variables in the dataset, making a total of 81 columns.

In the above 

t denotes time
f denotes frequency
mean(): Mean value of X, Y, Z
std(): Standard deviation of X, Y, Z
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
